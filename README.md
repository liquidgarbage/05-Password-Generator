## Description
I wanted to strech my Javascript skills by building a password generator. 
It was challenging at first, I struggled to get my head around storing the user input from the prompts/alerts. 
I asked a games developer friend for help (linked in the credits).
He guided me in how to break down each problem I was trying to solve. This massively helped. I felt able to approach each problem instead of getting overwhelmed by everything. 

Learning how to break the problems down effectively has made creating other projects less daunting. I also feel more able to ask for help. 

In terms of Javascript, I learnt about parseInt, functions and methods.
